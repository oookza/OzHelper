# OzHelper
This program automates Diablo 3 button presses.
Download at [OzHelper](https://github.com/oookza/OzHelper/releases) (It is a fork of [ZyHelper](https://github.com/ZyRaNex/ZyHelper))

# Install
1. Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Put OzHelperAdapter.cs in plugins\Oz in your TurboHUD folder
3. Extract OzHelper.zip somewhere else
4. Run OzHelper.ahk

# How to use:
There are 2 boxes per skill:
The Enabled Checkbox which enables/disables the skill.
The Hotkey Field which contains the hotkey thats going to get pressed by the program.
Here '1-9' 'a-z' mean their respective letters, while 'R' / 'L' mean the left / right mouse button.
For force stand still the additional hotkeys "shift", "alt" and "space" work.
The Necro has some additional features:
  'Second Sim' casts Simulacrum and Land of the Dead after 10-20 seconds from the start of the Greater Rift.
The buttons are self explanatory.

# Known bugs
If the TurboHUD overlay is transparent the helper will not work. I don't know how to change the TurboHUD transparency settings.
