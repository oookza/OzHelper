# How to use:

Per skill there are 2 Boxes:\
The Enabled Checkbox which enables/disables the skill.\
Note that the skill wont get casted if its not equipped.\
The Hotkey Field which contains the hotkey thats going to get pressed by the program.\
Here '1-9' 'a-z' mean their respective letters, while 'R' / 'L' mean the left / right mouse button.\
For force stand still the additional hotkeys "shift", "alt" and "space" work.\
The Necro has some additional features:\
'Second Sim' makes sim and land cast after 10-20 seconds so there is always a sim active if you play in a party.\
